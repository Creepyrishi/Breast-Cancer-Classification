<h1>Breast Cancer Data Set 🦠</h1>

<p>This dataset contains the characteristics of patients diagnosed with cancer. The dataset includes a unique ID for each patient, the type of cancer (diagnosis), and the visual characteristics of the cancer, along with their average values.</p>

<h2>Main Features 📚</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>id:</strong> Represents a unique ID for each patient.</li>
<li><strong>diagnosis:</strong> Indicates the type of cancer, categorized as "M" (Malignant - Benign) or "B" (Benign - Malignant).</li>
<li><strong>radius_mean, texture_mean, perimeter_mean, area_mean, smoothness_mean, compactness_mean, concavity_mean, concave points_mean:</strong> Represents the mean values of the cancer's visual characteristics.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Categorical Features 📊</h2>
<p>There are additional categorical features where patients in the dataset are labeled with numerical values. Refer to the Charts section for more details.</p>

<h2>Chart Tables 📈</h2>
<ul>
<li>The dataset includes several features with specific ranges of average values of the cancer's visual characteristics: <code>radius_mean</code>, <code>texture_mean</code>, <code>perimeter_mean</code>, <code>area_mean</code>, <code>smoothness_mean</code>, <code>compactness_mean</code>, <code>concavity_mean</code>, <code>concave points_mean</code>.</li>
<li>Each of these features is mapped to a table containing the number of values falling within a given range.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Sample Data 📝</h2>
<p>Each sample in the dataset contains the patient's unique ID, the cancer diagnosis, and the average values of the cancer's visual characteristics.</p>

<h2>Potential Applications 💡</h2>
<p>This dataset can be utilized for training or testing models and algorithms aimed at making cancer diagnoses. Analyzing the dataset can contribute to enhancing understanding of cancer-related visual features and diagnosis methods.</p>
